# About Me
Hi there! I'm a **Computer Science graduate** from **Università degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro**, currently working as a **Software Engineer** at **Tinexta Defence** in the **Space business unit**. I'm passionate about **technology**, **coding**, and the transformative potential of **satellite data processing** and **distributed systems**.

## Current Role
At Tinexta Defence, I'm focused on **satellite data processing systems**, working with missions like **IRIDE** and **EAGLET2**. My work involves handling **CCSDS format telemetry data** and developing processing pipelines that convert raw satellite telemetry into actionable data products.

## Technical Expertise
I work with a focused tech stack for space and distributed systems:
- **Languages**: Python, C++
- **Data Processing**: NumPy, binary data manipulation, satellite telemetry processing
- **Backend & Architecture**: Microservices, RESTful APIs
- **Databases**: MongoDB
- **DevOps & Tools**: Docker, Git, Linux systems
- **Frameworks**: Satellite data processing frameworks (CCSDS, Frame Processing Framework)

I'm experienced in designing scalable, containerized applications and working with complex data pipelines in Linux environments.

## Let's Connect
Always happy to connect over space systems, microservices, Python, or C++! Feel free to reach out here or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelegrieco92/).
