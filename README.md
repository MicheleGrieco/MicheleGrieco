# ðŸ’« About Me

Hi there! I'm a **Computer Science graduate** from **UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro**, passionate about **technology**, **coding**, and the world-changing potential of **Machine Learning** and **Artificial Intelligence**.

## ðŸŒ± Currently Learning

I'm diving into **cybersecurity** and **cryptography**, while refining my Python skills with libraries like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **TensorFlow**, and **Scikit-learn**. I'm also building web-based applications using the **Flask framework**, and planning to explore **Django** next. Alongside AI, Iâ€™m expanding my backend development skills with a focus on **microservices**, working with **Flask** (Python) and **Spring Boot** (Java).

## ðŸ’¡ What I'm Working On

Iâ€™m currently developing personal projects that combine **AI** and **security**, involving data preprocessing, neural networks, and cryptographic algorithms. I'm also designing and experimenting with **microservices architectures** to build scalable and modular applications.

## ðŸš€ Future Goals

My goals include deepening my expertise in **NLP**, **Computer Vision**, and **cloud-based AI systems**, while contributing to **open-source** projects. I'm also keen to explore the intersection of **AI** and **secure, distributed systems**, especially through **AI-powered microservices**.
