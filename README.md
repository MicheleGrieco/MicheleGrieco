# ðŸ’« About Me

Hi there! I'm a **Computer Science graduate** from **UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro**, passionate about **technology**, **coding**, and the world-changing potential of **Machine Learning** and **Artificial Intelligence**.

## ðŸŒ± Currently Learning

I'm diving into **cybersecurity** and **cryptography**, while refining my Python skills with libraries like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **TensorFlow**, and **Scikit-learn**. I'm also building web-based applications using the **Flask framework**, and planning to explore **Django** next. Alongside AI, Iâ€™m expanding my backend development skills with a focus on **microservices**, working with **Flask** (Python) and **Spring Boot** (Java).

## ðŸ’¡ What I'm Working On

I'm currently working on scalable and modular applications by designing and experimenting with microservices architectures. I'm also developing personal projects focused on security and AI, involving cryptographic algorithms, neural networks, and data preprocessing.

## ðŸš€ Future Goals

My goals include deepening my expertise in **NLP**, **Computer Vision**, and **cloud-based AI systems**, while contributing to **open-source** projects. I'm also keen to explore the intersection of **AI** and **secure, distributed systems**, especially through **microservices**.
